"""Unified keyword planner — deficit-pulled merged keyword generation (P1.6).

The planner is the generation half of the Discover double-buffered
backpressure model (design spec §5.2). It runs as its own background object
(constructed in ``api/runtime_context.py``, launched by the refresh
controller's ``run_forever``) and, when the
``[discovery].unified_keyword_planner_enabled`` flag is on, periodically:

1. Finds the ``due`` platforms — those whose keyword cache (``pending`` rows
   for the current ``profile_kw_digest``) is below ``kw_cache_low`` **and**
   that have a real search deficit (the controller's existing pool-replenish
   口径, including raw-material headroom + in-flight rows — NOT just visible
   pool rows). B站 additionally enters ``due`` on its existing catalysts
   (pool-below-target or ≥ ``signal_event_threshold`` pending signal events),
   even when its cache is not below low.
2. For every due platform, expires any stale-digest ``pending`` rows, then
   builds one merged ``<platforms>`` block and issues a **single** structured
   LLM call covering all due platforms. Parsed keywords are inserted as
   ``pending`` per platform under the current digest.
3. Decline vs failure (P2.2). When the merged call **succeeds**, a platform the
   model explicitly returned an empty list ``[]`` for is an **intentional
   decline** (its supply advantage doesn't fit the user) — it is skipped this
   cycle with NO interest-name fallback (it stays at its current pending and is
   re-offered next cycle if still due). A platform the model **omits** still
   falls back. When the merged call **fails entirely** (raised / no usable
   response), ALL due platforms fall back to deterministic interest names.
4. Rotation polish (P2.3). ``claim_keywords`` is FIFO (oldest pending first), so
   generated words rotate fairly. After a generation cycle, a non-declined due
   platform whose pending is still below ``kw_cache_low`` is conservatively
   topped up from its oldest ``used`` words via ``recycle_oldest_used`` (no
   extra LLM call) so variety keeps flowing; a declined platform is left alone.
   The sparse-profile recycle (generation + fallback produced nothing new)
   stays as the deeper safety valve.

It never fetches — fetch (claim → search) is P1.7. Single-flight is enforced
through the DB-level planner lock, whose write transaction is released
**before** the LLM call so a slow provider never blocks other writers.
